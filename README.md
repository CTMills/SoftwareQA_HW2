First, you must have python installed on your machine. I recommend going to https://www.python.org/to install the IDLE editor. Specifically I used python 3.8.5 to run the python program and to test it. Then, you can follow this link to the main branch of my GitHub repository to get the files: https://github.com/CTMills/SoftwareQA_HW2. On the landing page you should see a code button and when clicked you should be able to download my code as a zip file (see testing branch for testing file). Extract that wherever you see fit and after doing so you can run either in the python IDE or through powershell. I recommend the python IDE as it is easier. After unzipping my filesand opening your 
python IDE/going to the directory in powershell, you can either click “Run -> run module”for the file interface.py or use the command “python3 interface.py”assuming you have python on your PATH. This was developed on Ubuntu 21.0.4 and tested on both Linux Ubuntu 21.0.4 and Windows 10 Operating System
